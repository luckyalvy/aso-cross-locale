# ASO Cross-Locale Keywords Synchronizer
The Cross-Locale Keywords Synchronizer is an essential tool to synchronize keywords across multiple app localizations in the AppStore for your app. 

## Why does this tool exist?
It is important to optimize your ASO for the US and to make sure that your keywords don't overlap across different locales to maximize your overall keyword base, and you don't forget to add important ones into the title or subtitle. Also, include other common checks for length, duplicates, plurals, and Unicode symbols.

For more details on how cross-localization works in ASO and how it can effectively extend your keyword list, refer to [this comprehensive guide from AppFigures](https://appfigures.com/resources/guides/extend-keyword-list).

## How to use it?
Open [ASO Cross-Locale Keywords Synchronizer](https://luckyalvy.github.io/aso-cross-locale/aso-cross-locale.html) page in your browser. It is safe. No dependencies or third-party trackers. Only vanilla JS code which works with your keywords in your browser's tab only. All the keywords are saved into your browser's local storage, so you won't miss anything when you accidentally close your browser window.
